Press the "Origin" button to choose an origin.

The next screen will suggest you a place based on any text you type: an address, a point of interest, etc. Start typing an address, e.g. "117 boulevard voltaire".

Press the üîç button.

The next screen shows you the best journeys from your origin to your destination. The first item is the most "interesting" one because it has transfers.

Press the first item.

The last screen displays your journey in detail. You see each section of it, including when you have to wait or transfer from a transport mode to another.
